IC_Window
===================

To improve window aggregate queries in SciDB with Incremental Computation.
'ic_window' implemented into SciDB as a plugin user-defined-operator       

With aggregate operators: Sum, Avg, Max, Min
SciDB Version: 13.12

===================
How to Use:
copy libicwindow.so into the scidb plugin dir, 
run the following command within 'iquery' client of SciDB
AFL% load_library('icwindow');

Then operator 'ic_window' can be used.                                                                                                                  
Its parameter settings are same as the build-in operator 'window' in SciDB
Check in the SciDB-Userguide


 ====================
 To Make:                                                                
 Need to modify the Makefile, set the SciDB-Source Directory with correct location in your machine.                          
 A few libraries needed to compile, same ones as building SciDB from Source Code.
